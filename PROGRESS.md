## 2026-10-21 · Footage: downloads and first-pass shot analysis (T-102 partial, T-103 exploration)

**Done**
- Shortlisted seven clips uploaded by the Premier League channel itself (verified via oEmbed and `clip.info.json`,
  channel ID `UCG5qGWdu8nIRZqJ_GgDwQ-w`). Table in `data/footage/SOURCES.md`. Club-channel uploads in the
  "Club highlights 2026/27" playlist are outside the permission and excluded.
- Downloaded the four primary clips with yt-dlp 2026.08.19 (user's explicit go-ahead plus the Premier League written
  permission): `liverpool-mancity-2526`, `manutd-mancity-2526`, `arsenal-chelsea-2526`, `manutd-spurs-2425`, each
  `data/footage/<slug>/clip.mp4` at 1080p H.264 with `clip.info.json`. 3.5 GB total. Media is git-ignored by
  `data/footage/.gitignore`.
- Wrote a heuristic shot segmenter (`scripts/shots_firstpass.py`, contact sheets via
  `scripts/shots_contact_sheet.py`), tuned it three times against contact sheets. Results in
  `data/footage/SHOTS_REVIEW.md`; per-clip `shots.json` and `frames/` (git-ignored).
- Liverpool v Man City confirmed as primary tracking clip: 34 usable wide shots, 46% wide time, five unbroken wide
  shots of 67–88 s (13:22, 07:15, 10:35, 09:18, 26:34).

**Verification**
- `ffprobe` on all four clips: h264 1920x1080, durations 37:13 / 25:32 / 25:32 / 25:33.
- Contact sheets reviewed by eye; remaining false positives listed in `SHOTS_REVIEW.md`.

**Open**
- Original permission email as `.eml` with headers not yet in `docs/permissions/` (user action).
- Decision on real club and player names in overlays (user).
- Replays and slow motion are not detected; the first pass will mark a main-camera replay as wide.
- T-001 repo bootstrap not done: no git repo, no `packages/`, no `.venv`. The analysis ran in a throwaway venv.
- Three backup clips not downloaded.
